# Set Up NAS and DEV

I will get to this eventually.

This repo is for my personal use. I often play with VM's -- and I break them, too! By keeping all of my tools and script here, I
can quickly access what I need to rebuild a setup (especially when my backup copies somehow magically corrupt).

Note: I have a dotfiles repo, too, which I prefer keeping separate from the NAS Setup files.

Feel free to use whatever you see here. That's why this is a public repo, afterall! I do ask that you give credit if there's something
in here that you use. And if you don't, oh well! Enjoy  :D
